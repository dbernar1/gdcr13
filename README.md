Global Day of Code Retreat 2013
======

I coded with a Henry in this session. I did not get his contact info, so I can not find him online. I believe he works at a company named IC Group.

An interesting thing Henry brought up is that younger programmers often tend to be over-competitive, and it is unpleasant to work with them, and also often this competitiveness prevents them to get the best outcome when working. I know I've been guilty of this any number of times, so it was interesting to hear another person's perspective on that.

In this session we considered the notion that because we "answer" each test with the simplest implementation that could work, the next test should be one that proves that the current implementation is bogus. This can be useful when thinking about what test to write next.
