Global Day of Code Retreat 2013
======

I hooked up with https://github.com/davidwesst for this session. Because I've seen Dave present several times at the Winnipeg .NET user group, PrairieDevCon, etc, I thought of him as a bit of a celebrity. I was definitely pleasantly surprised by the amount of ability to hear the ideas I presented, because I find that a lot of other "experienced" people are less able to hear things that are not what they expected to hear.

We talked about the idea and goal of Business-readable code ( http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/BusinessReadableDSL.html ) , and one of the organizers, David Alpert complimented the code's readability, so that was nice, though I definitely thought it still had a long way to go to get to the point of being readable enough ( IMO, a domain expert with no knowledge of computer programming should be able to read large parts of any code that implements something in their domain ).

We also talked about what a finished software implementation of the Game of Life does. I think of input/output here. The input is the initial seed pattern, and the output is the set of generations the world goes through.
