Global Day of Code Retreat 2013
======

I coded with https://github.com/BenBergman in this 45 minute session. Ben uses a lot of shortcuts in vim that I do not use. I thought of an idea of switching .vimrc files when switching who is typing, though we did not do that. He also types on a Dvorak keyboard. That did not slow him down much, which is impressive in itself.

In this session, we tried out an idea I had regarding how to work test-first on a problem from the outside - if in the implementation of a function you use a function that does not yet exist, comment out the currently failing test, and switch the testing efforts to the "discovered" function. Once that is done, you go back "up" to the test that helped you discover the need for the new function.
